Mirror is a simple mocking framework for .NET, still in very early development.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is designed for simplicity, with a small API surface, no complicated fluent interfaces, and a compiled binary size under 15k.

Here are a few examples of its usage:


Creating a mock:
var mockRepo = new Mirror<IAccountRepository>();

Setting up a return value:
mockRepo.Returns(r => r.GetAccount(1001), new Account());

Setting up a callback:
mockRepo.Calls(r => r.GetAccount(1001), () => DoSomethingWhenAccountIsAccessed());

Setting up a thrown exception:
mockRepo.Throws(r => r.DeleteAccount(89736), new AccountSecurityException());

Allowing parameters of any value, with Any<T>.Value:
mockRepo.Returns(r => r.GetAccount(Any<int>.Value), new Account());

Determining how many times a method was called:
Assert.AreEqual(1, mockRepo.Calls(r.GetAccount(1001));

Getting a T from a Mirror<T>:
IAccountRepository accountRepository = mockRepo.It;
